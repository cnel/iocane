function spikeTrains = genStratifiedGaussian(N, M, param)
% Generate point process for a given stratified specification
% spikeTrains = genStratifiedGaussian(N, M, param)
% The joint distributions are restricted to be multi-variate Gaussian
%
% Input
%   N: trials per spikeTrains
%   M: number of sets of trials
%   param.D: maximum dimension
%   param.T: length of the spike train
%   param.mean: {Dx1} cell each containing d dimensional vector of means
%   param.sigma: {Dx1} cell each containing dxd covaraince matirx
