function spikeTrains = genRenewalGamma(N, M, param)
% Generate renewal process with interval distribution that follows Gamma dist.
% spikeTrains = genRenewalGamma(N, M, param)
%
% Input
%   N: trials per spikeTrains
%   M: number of sets of trials
%   param.rate: mean rate
%   param.shape: shape parameter
%   param.T: length of simulation
%
% samples from gamma distribution: gamrnd(shape_param,scale_param)
% mean = shape_param * scale_param
% var = shape_param * scale_param^2
% The mean firing rate is 1/mean of interval distribution, rate = 1/mean
